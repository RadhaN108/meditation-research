The guided meditation session will last for a <b>duration of 10 minutes</b>. At the end of the session, you will be given a set of questions which you can either type the answers for or record your answers and send them to us. These questions should take you no longer than 20 minutes.
<br><br>
Note: Please make sure you answer the questions immediately at the end of the session so that we can get your best perspective about the session.
